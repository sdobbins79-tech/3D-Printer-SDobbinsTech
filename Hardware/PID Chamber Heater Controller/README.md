# PID Chamber Heater Controller

![PID chamber heater controller render](./images/front-render.png)

This project documents a standalone PID controller enclosure for a chamber heater setup. It is not tied to one specific printer.

## Current Status

This page covers the PID controller box and enclosure assembly. The PTC heater and fan assembly is still in progress and will be documented later.

## Safety Warning

This project uses mains AC power and a heater control circuit. Incorrect wiring can cause shock, fire, damaged equipment, or injury. Do not build or power this project unless you understand mains wiring and can verify every connection with the exact parts you are using.

Before powering the controller:

- Verify the input voltage used by your PID controller, fan power supply, heater, and power inlet.
- Verify the fuse rating matches the load and wire size.
- Verify the SSR rating is suitable for the heater load and is mounted to a heat sink correctly.
- Verify all ground connections are secure.
- Verify no exposed terminals can contact the printed enclosure or loose wiring.
- Verify the heater has proper airflow before it is allowed to run.
- Verify the temperature sensor is mounted where it can accurately measure chamber temperature.

## Electrical Rating Notes

The linked heater for this build is listed as `110V 500W`, which is about `4.55A`.

The PID kit includes an `SSR-40DA` style solid state relay, commonly marked as `40A`. Do not treat the SSR label as the safe rating for the full build. The real safe limit depends on the fuse, wire gauge, IEC inlet, SSR heat sinking, airflow, enclosure temperature, and build quality.

Treat this as a `500W heater build` unless you are qualified to re-rate the entire electrical system.

## Assembly Instructions

### 1. Gather the parts

![Gather parts](./images/pid-controller-01.jpg)

Lay out the printed enclosure, PID controller kit, SSR, heat sink, thermocouple, fused power inlet, fan controller, heater wiring, and hardware before assembly. Confirm that the printed enclosure openings match the parts before starting.

### 2. Install the rear M3 heat-set inserts

![Rear heat-set inserts](./images/pid-controller-02.jpg)

Install M3 heat-set inserts into the rear holes of the enclosure. Keep the inserts straight and flush so the rear hardware can fasten cleanly later.

### 3. Install the bottom M3 heat-set inserts

![Bottom heat-set inserts](./images/pid-controller-03.jpg)

Install two additional M3 heat-set inserts in the bottom of the enclosure. These are used for fastening internal components and keeping the assembly secure.

### 4. Prepare the PID-to-SSR control wire

![PID to SSR wire](./images/pid-controller-04.jpg)

Prepare a short PID-to-SSR control wire, approximately `100 mm / 4 in` long. This wire connects the PID controller output to the SSR input. Use terminals that match the PID and SSR screw terminals, and leave enough length for service without creating extra loose wire inside the enclosure.

### 5. Prepare the fan controller

![Fan controller](./images/pid-controller-05.jpg)

Prepare the fan controller and attach double-sided tape to the back of the controller housing. This lets the fan speed controller mount in the shown position.

### 6. Route the fan controller plug

![Route fan controller plug](./images/pid-controller-06.jpg)

Pass the fan controller plug through the largest of the three rear holes. Attach the controller as shown and make sure the cable is not pinched or stretched.

### 7. Install the power inlet, sensor, heater wiring, and power supply wiring

![Install power inlet and wiring](./images/pid-controller-07.jpg)

Install the fused power inlet in the rear opening. Route the temperature sensor and heater wiring through the rear holes. Attach the power supply or power inlet assembly with M3 screws as shown in the build photos.

Before continuing, verify the power inlet orientation and confirm which terminal is live, neutral, and ground. Do not rely on wire color alone.

### 8. Position the wires for the PID unit

![Position PID wiring](./images/pid-controller-08.jpg)

Position the wires so the PID controller can slide into place without crushing or sharply bending the connectors. Tie a knot in the appropriate wire as strain relief to help prevent the wire from pulling through the enclosure.

### 9. Install the PID-to-SSR wire on the PID unit

![Install PID wiring](./images/pid-controller-09.jpg)

Install the `100 mm / 4 in` PID-to-SSR wire prepared earlier onto the PID controller. Bend electrical connectors only as needed for clearance when installing the PID unit into the printed enclosure.

Do not over-bend terminals or leave them close enough to short against another terminal.

### 10. Prepare the SSR and heat sink interface

![Prepare SSR](./images/pid-controller-10.jpg)

Prepare the SSR and heat sink mounting surface. If the mating surface is coated, rough, or uneven, sand the mounting surface back to bare metal where needed for better thermal contact. Apply thermal paste or the selected thermal interface material between the SSR and heat sink.

Do not sand electrical terminals, labels, or insulated wiring. Clean off dust before assembly.

### 11. Install and wire the SSR

![Install SSR](./images/pid-controller-11.jpg)

Install an M3 screw with washer in the forward lower hole, then attach the wiring to the SSR. Install the SSR onto the heat sink. Attach the ground wire from the power inlet to the rear heat sink screw.

Before closing the enclosure, tug-check the crimped terminals, verify the SSR input and output sides are wired correctly, and confirm the ground connection is secure.

## Pre-Power Checklist

- Confirm the fuse value is correct for the heater load.
- Confirm the SSR is mounted to the heat sink with thermal paste or a verified thermal pad.
- Confirm the ground wire is attached to the heat sink screw.
- Confirm all mains wiring is secured and insulated.
- Confirm the PID controller input voltage matches the power source.
- Confirm the thermocouple is connected to the correct PID terminals.
- Confirm the fan controller and fan run before enabling the heater.
- Confirm the PTC heater has forced airflow.
